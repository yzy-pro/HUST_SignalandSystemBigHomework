Q3 Time-Domain Demodulation - Summary
=======================================

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✓

Algorithm Steps:
1. High-pass filtering (8th-order Butterworth, fc = 3225.10 Hz)
2. Carrier multiplication with cos(2πf_d·t), gain = 2.0
3. Low-pass filtering (8th-order Butterworth, fc = 4000 Hz)
4. Spectrum analysis at each stage

Key Results:
- Original signal peak: 3225.16 Hz (matches f_d)
- Demodulated audio saved: Q3_demodulated.wav
- 4 spectrum plots generated showing demodulation process
- Signal successfully shifted from carrier to baseband

Output Files (6 total):
