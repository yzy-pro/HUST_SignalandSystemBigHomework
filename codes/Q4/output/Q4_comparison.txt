Q4 vs Q3 Comparison Results
============================

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 5.544647e-3
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 7.446239e-2
Maximum absolute difference: 0.964926
Correlation coefficient: -0.027949
Signal-to-Noise Ratio: -12.28 dB

Interpretation:
---------------
✗ Low correlation - significant differences
~ Low SNR - noticeable difference

Method differences:
-------------------
Q3 (Time-domain):
  - Uses 8th-order Butterworth filters (non-ideal)
  - IIR filter implementation (Direct Form II)
  - Non-linear phase response
  - Gradual transition band

Q4 (Frequency-domain):
  - Uses ideal brick-wall filters
  - Frequency-domain multiplication
  - No phase distortion from filters
  - Sharp cutoff
